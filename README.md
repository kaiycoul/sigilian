SIGILIAN

 Students of magic scoff at the idea of sigilians. Living spells fleeing their tomes? Ridiculous. More likely a hazing ritual to frighten new students.

 BORN OF INK AND PAGE. More experienced mages know sigilians are no prank. Whether intentionally created or born from improperly transcribed spells, they exist. They commonly appear as swirling clouds of glowing runes.

 HUNGER FOR KNOWLEDGE. Sigilians live unseen in libraries, arcing between books, eating words, and leaving behind scrambled passages. They're most dangerous when they enter spellbooks, where they can eat inscribed spells.

 STICKS AND STONES. Undisturbed sigilians are docile, but the destructive nature of their hunger makes it impossible for librarians and wizards to live and let live. Left alone, they can become powerful, self-aware, intelligent sigilians that store most of the words that form them in heavy tomes similar to a lich's phylactery.
